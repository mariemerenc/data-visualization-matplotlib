# Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Course offered by Datacamp - a platform for data science and artificial intelligence courses. Each Python notebook corresponds to a chapter of the course.
The material was adapted by me.

By the end of the course, the student is expected to know how to create visualizations for different kinds of data and how to customize, automate, and share these visualizations.
